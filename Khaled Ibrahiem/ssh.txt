An SSH key is a secure way to connect your computer to another computer or server without using a password.
SSH stands for Secure Shell. It is a method used to safely communicate between two computers over the internet.
An SSH key works using two files:
Private Key
	Stored on your computer
	Must be kept secret
	Used to prove your identity

Public Key
	Shared with services like GitHub
	Safe to share
	Used to verify your identity

Advantages of SSH Key
	More secure than passwords
	Faster login (no need to type password)
	Safer for developers working with Git
