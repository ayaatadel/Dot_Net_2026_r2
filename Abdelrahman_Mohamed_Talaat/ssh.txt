SSH Key: Is used to securly connect to github without the need to username and password credentials it contains two parts:
1- Private Key: This key must not be shared with anyone even on github.
2- Public Key: This is the key which we share on github to connect local pc to github 

This Command used to create the ssh key :  ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "podap384@gmail.com"


After adding public ssh key to github account we should connect the private ssh key to the private one.


This Command is used to ensure that the connection is done 
ssh -T git@github.com
If the result is (Hi <username>! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.) this means that the connection is done with github.



To create the agent that will manage the connection between pc and github we should use this command: eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
This creates an agent to connect with the and let you do commands without the need of credintials.



This Command ( ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519) used to add the private ssh key to the agent (locally).
