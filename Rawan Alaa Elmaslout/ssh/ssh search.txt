SSH (Secure Shell)
1. What is SSH?

SSH (Secure Shell) is a network protocol used to securely connect to another computer over a network. It allows users to log in remotely, transfer files, and execute commands safely.

SSH encrypts communication between computers so that passwords and data cannot be stolen by attackers.

Example:

Connecting from your laptop to a server

Managing a remote Linux machine

Using GitHub via SSH

2. Why SSH is Important 🔐

SSH provides:

1️⃣ Security

Data is encrypted

Protects against hackers

Secure login

2️⃣ Remote Access

Control another computer from anywhere

Run commands remotely

3️⃣ File Transfer

Using:

SCP (Secure Copy)

SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol)

3. How SSH Works
Step 1 — Client Requests Connection

The user connects to a remote server.

Example:

ssh username@192.168.1.10
Step 2 — Authentication

Two main methods:

1️⃣ Password Authentication

User enters password.

Example:

Username: student
Password: ********
2️⃣ Key Authentication (More Secure)

Uses two keys:

Public Key → stored on server

Private Key → stored on your computer

Example files:

id_rsa        (Private key)
id_rsa.pub    (Public key)
Step 3 — Secure Connection

SSH creates an encrypted tunnel.

All data becomes unreadable to attackers.

4. SSH Architecture

SSH has two main parts:

SSH Client

The computer that connects.

Examples:

Windows Terminal

Git Bash

PuTTY

SSH Server

The computer being connected to.

Example:

Linux server

Cloud server

5. SSH Port

Default SSH port:

Port 22

Example connection:

ssh user@server.com -p 22
6. SSH Commands
Connect to Server
ssh username@hostname

Example:

ssh student@192.168.1.5
Copy File to Server
scp file.txt user@server:/home/user
Download File
scp user@server:file.txt .
7. SSH vs Telnet
Feature	SSH	Telnet
Security	Encrypted 🔐	Not encrypted ❌
Safe Password	Yes	No
Port	22	23
Recommended	Yes ✅	No ❌

SSH replaced Telnet because it is much more secure.

8. Advantages of SSH

✔ Secure communication
✔ Remote control
✔ File transfer
✔ Authentication with keys
✔ Widely used

9. Disadvantages of SSH

❌ Requires configuration
❌ Can be complex for beginners
❌ Key management needed

10. Real Uses of SSH

SSH is used in:

GitHub (push and pull code)

Cloud servers

Linux administration

Networking

DevOps

Example:

git clone git@github.com:user/project.git
