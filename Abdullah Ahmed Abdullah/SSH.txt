Definition: SSH (Secure Shell) is a cryptographic network protocol used to securely access and communicate with remote systems over an unsecured network.

Main Purpose:
- Secure remote login to servers
- Secure file transfer
- Secure communication between machines
- Authentication without passwords (using keys)

SSH Authentication Methods:
- Password Authentication: Username + password, Less secure, Vulnerable to brute-force attacks
- Key-Based Authentication: Uses asymmetric cryptography, No password required after setup

SSH Key Pair Structure, When generating an SSH key, two files are created:
- Private Key: Stored locally,Must remain secret, Used to sign authentication requests
- Public Key: Shared with remote server, Used to verify identity

commands:
=> ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "apdallaahmed307@gmail.com"
=> eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
=> ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
=> cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
